# C# GNFS

C# .NET implementation of the general number field sieve for factoring large semi-primes including polynomial selection, relations collection, and line sieving.

Feel free to browse the code. Also, here is some literature on the subject of General Number Field Sieves that helped guide me during the construction of this project:
